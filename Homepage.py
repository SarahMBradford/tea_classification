This app will enable you to easily view the various tea drinks that Starbucks has to offer, if one day you are trying to decide whether you should order tea or coffee! The data used in this app is from the Starbucks Menu dataset on Kaggle. The data was collected in 2017 and contains nutritional information on Starbucks' drink menu. The dataset has 242 rows and 18 columns. Additionally, the data contains a total of 9 beverage categories. Out of the 9, roughly 78% are coffee-based drinks and less than 1% are smoothies, while the remaining 21% of the beverages are tea-based. ")

Tea has several health benefits, including reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks while boosting the immune system and simultaneously reducing the risk of cancer. Tea contains less caffeine than coffee, so it is an ideal alternative for those who get overstimulated. Lastly, tea is also a great option for people who desire to reduce their sugar and fat intake, as many tea drinks are naturally sweet and do not require added sugar or creamers.")
